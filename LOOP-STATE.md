# LOOP-STATE — Career hop harness

Tier: L1
Reason: quality-gate CLI only. Does not touch `public/` routes or production deploy artifacts.

## Loop 0 snapshot
- Repo: ericzheng-lab/ai-drsfilms-portfolio
- Base: origin/main at 13a21279890be53bddaeb1a4ea930d8118e42b28
- Static convention: `public/<company>/index.html` → `https://ai.drsfilms.com/{company}/`
- Prior completed L2 (historical): Alibaba Startup Deck, PR #10, `71a37122e12157c42c4c79164cd1834efdb8bce4`

## Guardrails
- Quality gate only. Do not apply to jobs. Do not restyle the public site.
- Do not alter existing portfolio routes.
- Fixtures synthetic only. No invented biography.
- Nobody may waive Profile or cover letter.
- career-ops PR #5 is scrap only; checker canon lives here.

## DoD
- [x] D1: `node harness/cli.js --self-test` exits 0
- [x] D2: four fixtures behave (skip-profile REJECT / generic-homepage REJECT / missing-cl REJECT / pass-minimal-three ACCEPT)
- [x] D3: `public/` and site source untouched vs origin/main
- [x] D4: Draft PR #17 open; not merged (https://github.com/ericzheng-lab/ai-drsfilms-portfolio/pull/17)

## Loop log
- Loop 0: read origin/main, existing Actions `deploy.yml`, career-ops PR #5 as scrap.
- Loop 1: add `harness/` CLI, versioned rules, schema, fixtures, isolated Actions workflow.
- Verify: `--self-test` green; fixture hops match named outcomes; `git diff origin/main -- public src` empty.
- Draft PR: https://github.com/ericzheng-lab/ai-drsfilms-portfolio/pull/17 (not merged).

- Loop 2: close leftover harness classes on `feat/career-hop-harness` (R3 content rescan, live 2xx+marker Profile, novel waiver/skip class, company aliases, lib integrity pin). No merge. No `public/` restyle. No apply.
- Loop 3: close remaining holes on `feat/career-hop-harness` — R3 re-runs VI provenance; reject full-shaped id+PASS stub reports; company_aliases not builder-self-certified; skip-language nice-to-have / company-page synonyms; pin comparison moved into pinned `lib/integrity.js`. Draft PR #17. No merge. No `public/` restyle. No apply.
- Loop 4: close leftover #1 on `feat/career-hop-harness` — prerequisite ACCEPT is `decideVerdict(checks)`, not the self-certified verdict field. Forged prereq that copies live FAILs + ACCEPT + recomputed binding is REJECT. R0/R1/R2-only gates (brief-selected-work-ids, cv-header-not-homepage, r2-html-noindex) survive forged prereq. Cheap extras: Metaphor+meta prefix collision REJECT; live marker requires dedicated `/{slug}/` path. Draft PR #17. No merge. No `public/` restyle. No apply. Leftovers #2–#5 stay closed.
- Loop 5: supervisor `--verify --hop R3` on `feat/career-hop-harness`. Re-runs R3 live and re-derives `decideVerdict`; missing / handwritten / disk-vs-live disagreement is REJECT. Disk `R3.json` verdict is never sufficient before ATS fill. Leftovers #1–#5 stay closed. Draft PR #17. No merge. No `public/` restyle. No apply.
